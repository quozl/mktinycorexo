How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB stick from upstream
distribution components.

1.  select a USB stick that has nothing on it that is wanted,

2.  select a system for building with; best fit is an XO-1.5 running
os108, or later, or some other Linux system, (the script obtains the
os108 kernel from the internet if it is not available on your system),
then plug the USB stick into it,

3.  identify the USB stick from /proc/partitions, usually /dev/sda,

4.  ensure you have an internet connection,

5.  as root run the script:

    mktinycorexo /dev/sdZ

... where /dev/sdZ is the answer you obtained from step 3 above,

6.  wait for completion,

7.  boot from the USB stick.
