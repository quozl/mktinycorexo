How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB drive
from upstream distribution components:

1.  select a USB drive that has nothing on it that is wanted,

2.  select a system for building with; last tested on an XO-4 running
OLPC OS 13.1.0, or use some other Linux system, (the script obtains
the kernel from the internet if it is not available on your system),
then plug the USB drive into it,

3.  identify the USB drive from /proc/partitions, such as /dev/sdc1,

4.  ensure you have an internet connection,

5.  clone the repository,

    git clone http://dev.laptop.org/~quozl/mktinycorexo/.git
    cd mktinycorexo

6.  as root run the script:

    sudo mktinycorexo /dev/sdc1

... where /dev/sdc1 is the answer you obtained from step 3 above,
(take care, because any directory called boot on this device will be
changed),

7.  wait for completion,

8.  boot from the USB drive,

9.  if disk space is required, you can remove the cache/ directory, as
it contains downloads only.
